/**
 * This class represents the authorizations for an action. It's associated to a label,
 * a description, the bit in which flags are saved, and obviously the authorization array which is
 * encapsulated in the RolesAuthorizations class.
 * The bit which is used to store the authorization is 2^n where n is the number of the place you want
 * to use. It's recommanded to begin with 1 (2^0 = 1) then 2 (2^1 = 2) then 4 (2^2 = 4) etc...
 * In this class the select of Visitor level is not possible.

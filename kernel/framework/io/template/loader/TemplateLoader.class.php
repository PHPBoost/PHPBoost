/**
 * This class is responsible to load a template and transform it in the PHPBoost parsed template
 * syntax.
 * Normally a loader is able to load a template and provide its parsed form. The parsing is done by
 * a TemplateParser it embeds and is a quite heavy operation. To be more efficient, we've introduced
 * the parsed files caching which enables us to parse each file only once and then reuse the cache.
 * Even if the {@link TemplateLoader} interface knows the cache notion, that doesn't mean that the
 * implementation has to support caching. It's the reason why there is the {@link supports_caching()} method.

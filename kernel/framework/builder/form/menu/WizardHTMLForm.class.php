/**
 * This class is a child of HTMLForms for a wizard menu and enables you to handle all the operations regarding forms.
 * Indeed, you build a form using object components (fieldsets, fields, buttons) and it's able to display, to retrieve
 * the posted values and also validate the entered data from constraints you define.
 * The validation is done in PHP when the form is received, but also in live thanks to Javascript (each field is
 * validated when it looses the focus and the whole form is validated when the user submits it).
